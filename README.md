## WIP: Not Usable

Globe is a lightweight and efficient compiler backend developed in the Gleam programming language. It provides an Intermediate Language (IL) and Intermediate Representation (IR) to facilitate code transformation and optimization. Globe is designed to generate C99 code, making it compatible with a wide range of platforms and toolchains.

## Quick start

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
gleam shell # Run an Erlang shell
```

## Installation

If available on Hex this package can be added to your Gleam project:

```sh
gleam add globe
```

and its documentation can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/globe>.
